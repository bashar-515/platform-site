      Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Bashar. I'm an
      NYC-based developer who loves all things programming. Currently, I'm a
      cloud engineer at a robotics company working to streamline the process of
      building and deploying fleets of machines. My hobbies include writing
      code, watching movies, doing kickflips, running, and many many other
      things.
